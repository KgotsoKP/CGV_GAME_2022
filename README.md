## About the game
Lights is a game that is built on one rule: Run towards the green and stay away from red. If the avatar keeps running toward red, their health bar decreases until they die, within a short space of time the longer you take, the faster it goes. As a player, you will be in a simulated environment (difficulty to change with levels), you pick up coins to win, and there will be many obstacles in the game. Our game focused, on a player running on an infinite land, collecting points and increasing their life span as they collect green life balls. The complexity increases and changes as you go up in levels as you are introduced to other exciting challenges that will leave you yearning to keep playing.

## Design Style
Our main style was to use different functions from different classes to interact with data and create and place objects in the environment which was our scene. So both scene graphs (provided by the THREE.js) and sub-hierarchical modelling design the entirety of the game. 

Since this is a runner-based game we took the approach of continuously filling the level with boosters and obstacles for the player to keep on playing
